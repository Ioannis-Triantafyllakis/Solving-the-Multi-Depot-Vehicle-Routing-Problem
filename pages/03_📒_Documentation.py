    A MDVRP is a non-deterministic polynomial-hard (NP-hard) combinatorial optimization problem and \
    solving it by exact algorithm is time consuming and computationally intractable, [2] and constitutes\
    of more than one depot, a few customers that must be served, and a specified number of vehicles that \
    start and end in the same depot after serving customers. To solve a MDVRP, customers need to be assigned\
    first in a depot, and then the routing process can take place.\

        An MDVRP solution construction algorithm can be formulated as a two-phase process: a ***Selection*** phase can be implemented\
        first, in order to find which customers will be served by which depot, and then a ***Routing*** phase can be used in order to\
        solve all the distinct VRPs created by the first phase.4 different heuristics are suggested, where the first phase\
        (the Selection phase) is based on 4 different clustering methods (one for each heuristic), while the second phase\
        (the Routing phase) is the same in all four heuristics, in which a variation of the Clarke and Wright heuristic with\
        a vehicle number constraint is used. The methodology flow of the algorithms can be seen in the right.\

st.write("\
    K-Means Clustering-Based Node Selection Algorithm is the first out of four different algorithms that are used in\
    the first phase (Selection Phase) of the proposed MDVRP heuristic. This algorithm utilizes the K-Means Clustering\
    algorithm that was suggested by Ball and Hall (1965) [1]. The goal of K-Means Algorithm is to correctly separate\
    observations in a dataset into groups based on objects properties, and in our case based on customer\
    x and y coordinates.\
    ")

st.write("\
    The algorithm works as follows: at first, centroids are randomly initialized whose number is equal to the number\
    of clusters/groups, and then each observation is assigned to each closest centroid based on a distance criterion\
    (Euclidean distance in our implementation). Then for each centroid, a new centroid/mean is calculated, and the initial\
    centroid of the corresponding cluster is moved into the position of the new centroid. If there was a movement, the algorithm\
    repeats itself, while if there was not move, the algorithm terminates.\
